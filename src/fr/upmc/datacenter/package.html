The package <code>fr.upmc.datacenter</code> provides for a basic data center
simulation written in a component-based fashion using the Basic Component
Model (BCM).
</p>

<p><b>Data center simulator design</b></p>

<p>
The data center provides physical resources, i.e. computers.  Each computer
has a fixed number of processors, each of which having a fixed number of cores.
</p>
<p>
Processors are simulated by components described by <code>Processor</code>. A
processor component offers an interface <code>ProcessorServicesI</code>
declaring task execution services, including the submission of a task for
execution and notification of its completion. To do the notifications, the
processor component requires the interface
<code>ProcessorServicesNotificationI</code>.
</p>
<p>
Cores in a processor can execute at different admissible frequencies that can
be set using the interface <code>ProcessorManagementI</code> offered by the
component. When starting, cores operate at a given default frequency.  When
setting a new frequency, it must be admissible and also obey a coherence
constraint for the processor limiting the difference between the frequencies
of its cores to a certain maximum gap.
</p>
<p>
To help managing them, processor components also offers interfaces to get
static and dynamic state data about them, both in pull or push mode.
</p>
<p>
Computers are simulated are simulated by components described by
<code>Computer</code>. Computer manages the reservation of cores by application
virtual machines. Computer components offer the interface
<code>ComputerServicesI</code>, through which one can request the allocation
of one or more cores among the available ones of the computer processors.
When allocated, a description of the core and all the necessary information
to connect to the processor component holding it are provided to the
requester.
</p>
<p>
To help managing them, computer components also offers interfaces to get
static and dynamic state data about them, both in pull or push mode.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the data center provides application virtual machines simulated by
<code>ApplicationVM</code> components.  An AVM component offers the interface
<code>RequestSubmissionI</code> to receive the request submissions for the
application, and it requires the interface <code>RequestNotificationI</code>
to notify the completion of a request.  AVM components use processor cores to
execute the requests. AVM offers the interface
<code>ApplicationVMManagementI</code> exposing a method to allocate it cores
from processors of a single computer.
</p>

<p>
The next figure shows the deployment of a minimal data center where a computer
with two processors provides cores from both of its processors to a single
application VM. Components, their ports and their interconnections are given:
